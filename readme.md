** Templets

** Folders
a-pages
b-layouts
c-regions
d-components
e-units

The rules for templets are:
* Follow the folder structure to keep in alphbetical order
* Each level gets closer to the data
* Data from entities should only go in d-components or e-units
* d- components is for blocks of code
* regions is just for tighter structure
* layouts is simple structure
* pages is for the base templets
